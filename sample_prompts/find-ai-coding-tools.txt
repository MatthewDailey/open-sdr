I am building a tool that helps coding agents find and read documentation. I need your help finding leads to talk to at agent development companies. 

I need you to research and find a list of all the startups building AI coding tools. 

Please do multiple rounds of research to find everything.

Here is a list I already know, I need you to find even more like these.
  All Hands 
  Autify
  Cognition - devin wiki feature could just have Ref installed, have user pick documentation they need
  Cursor
  Zed
  Factory
  Imbue
  Lovable
  bolt.new
  v0
  Magic
  Poolside
  qodo
  tessl
  replit
  refact.ai

  Tusk (resolveai)
  fine.dev
  Variant (maybe Toni knows)
  ion design
  Trae (hackathon people)
  goose (hackathon people)
  claude code devs
  Factory
  CODIRIS 
  kodu.ai
  void https://github.com/voideditor/void
  RooCode 

In your final output give me a list like:
```
<company> (<tool>) <company url>
<company> (<tool>) <company url>
...
```

Speak briefly outload to let me know you're down.
