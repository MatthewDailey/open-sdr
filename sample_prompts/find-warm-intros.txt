Your task is to:
1. Verify if this is a tool or a company. If it is a tool, find the company name. This is very important so we can find all the correct background and connections
2. Gather background on the company.
3. Find a good person to talk to about trying my tool (Ref). 

Important notes:
- When searching for linkedin links, ALWAYS use the actual company name you've found and not the product name.
- The most important thing is to get the Linkedin profile URLs for the people to talk to and mutual connections if we are not directly connected.

How to proceed:
- Have a separate sub-agent look into each tool.
- When a sub-agent finishes, have it speak just to say "finished looking into on <>". It should also write a SDR note about the company that includes linkedin urls.
- When all sub-agents finish, write an overall summary report to "multi-query.md" with overall summary.

What I want is a list like the following that should inclue every company on my list above:
<company1>:
- <person to talk to> <linkedin url>
  → <person who can give a warm intro> <url>
  → <person who can give a warm intro> <url>
  ..as many warm intros as we can find..
- <person to talk to> <linkedin url>
  → <person who can give a warm intro> <url>
  ..
..as many persons to talk to as we find..
<company2>:
...
